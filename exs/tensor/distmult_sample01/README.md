# T-PRISM DistMult Program

This program "distmult_sample.psm" is a most simple T-PRISM program.
So, it is  not efficient but a good example.

This program computes element-wise product of three vectors extracted a set of vectors, named DistMult.
Also, this program train the vectros from data written in "sample.dat".

"run.sh" shows how to run these scripts.
